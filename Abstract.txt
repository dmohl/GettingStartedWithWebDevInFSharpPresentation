Title: Getting Started With F# Web Development

Abstract: 

Many of the features provided by F# lend themselves well to web development. In this talk, we will quickly go over some of the basics of the F# language, then dive into four quick ways to get started developing web application in F#. By the end, we will have built an F# and C# Silverlight application, an F# only Silverlight application, an F# and C# ASP.NET MVC 2 web application, and a web application with a platform called WebSharper.
